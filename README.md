## Day 1
  ### introduction-to-risc-v-isa
  The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) is is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses
  ### RISC-V software toolchain 
  there is a several ways for programmers to make and compile and reviwe each code they are programming in linux systems  
       1. the simple way and its by using `gcc <file name > ` this command creating for us output file that contains the results 
       
        2. the Risc-V toolchain
